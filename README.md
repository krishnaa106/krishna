## Running the Bot

Lixon uses `pm2` to manage the bot process.

1.  **Install PM2 globally (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    npm install -g pm2
    ```

2.  **Make the session:**
    ```bash
    node ./lib/client.js
    ```

3.  **Exit:**
    ```bash
    ctrl+c
    ```

4.  **Start the bot:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Alternatively, you can start it directly with `pm2`:
    ```bash
    pm2 start ./lib/client.js --name lixon
    ```

## Process Management

You can manage the bot process using these commands:

-   **Check logs:**
    ```bash
    pm2 logs lixon
    ```
-   **Stop the bot:**
    ```bash
    npm stop
    ```
-   **Restart the bot:**
    ```bash
    pm2 restart lixon
    ```
